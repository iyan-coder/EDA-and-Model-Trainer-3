        "A Portuguese bank ran several **phone‚Äëbased direct‚Äëmarketing campaigns** to convince clients to subscribe to a term deposit.  \n",
        "Your task is to **predict whether a client will subscribe (`y`)** using the historic campaign data in **`bank.csv`**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it matters  \n",
        "- **Marketing efficiency**¬†‚Äì call only the clients most likely to convert.  \n",
        "- **Customer experience**¬†‚Äì avoid annoying customers with irrelevant calls.  \n",
        "- **Cost reduction**¬†‚Äì fewer wasted minutes ‚Üí lower outbound‚Äëcall costs.\n",

        "|--------|------|--------------------------------|\n",
        "| `age` | numeric | Customer‚Äôs age in years. Often‚ÄØU‚Äëshaped effect: middle‚Äëaged clients may be more financially stable, retirees may have idle funds. |\n",
        "| `job` | categorical | Profession (e.g., *management*, *services*, *technician*). Relates to **income level** and financial literacy. |\n",
        "| `marital` | categorical | *married*, *single*, *divorced*. Life stage can affect saving goals. |\n",
        "| `education` | categorical | *primary*, *secondary*, *tertiary*, *unknown*. Higher education often ‚Üó adoption of financial products. |\n",
        "| `default` | categorical | Has credit in default? *yes/no*. Strong negative signal for new deposits. |\n",
        "| `balance` | numeric | Average yearly bank balance (EUR). Proxy for liquidity and trust in the bank. |\n",
        "| `housing` | categorical | Has a housing loan? Indicates existing liabilities. |\n",
        "| `loan` | categorical | Has personal loan? Similar to above; can reduce disposable income. |\n",
        "| `contact` | categorical | Contact channel (*cellular*, *telephone*, *unknown*). Campaigns via mobile often perform better. |\n",
        "| `day` | numeric | Last contact day of month (1‚Äì31). Not very predictive alone; combine with `month`. |\n",
        "| `month` | categorical | *jan‚ÄØ‚Ä¶‚ÄØdec*. Strong seasonal pattern: e.g., **May** & **October** often see spikes. |\n",
        "| `duration` | numeric | Call length in seconds. ***Most predictive*** feature (longer calls ‚Üí higher likelihood of ‚Äúyes‚Äù) but beware: **leakage** if used in real‚Äëtime predictions. |\n",
        "| `campaign` | numeric | Number of contacts with this client during the campaign. Repeated calls may wear people out. |\n",
        "| `pdays` | numeric | Days passed since client was last contacted (‚àí1 means *never*). Small value ‚áí recently called. |\n",
        "| `previous` | numeric | How many prior contacts in past campaigns. |\n",
        "| `poutcome` | categorical | Outcome of the **previous** campaign (*success*, *failure*, *other*, *unknown*). Historical success is a strong positive signal. |\n",
